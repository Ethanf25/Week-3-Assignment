        What type of clothing is best for each occasion? Well, for starters it depends on the weather
        type and what season. If you're looking to fish during the summer, for sure just shorts, a t-shirt,
        and maybe some sunglasses with a hat to protect yourself from the sun! Now it's flipped if you're wanting
        to fish in let's say the winter time, you'll want to be bundles up, so you'll need a lot more sucha as a pair
        of bibs, a thick jacket, boots, a hat, a face shield, and some warm gloves. Definitely would want to bring
        a heater and an ice shanty to help keep warm! Also, comfort is key, you'd want to be wearing something you'd be comfortable 
        being in for hours on end.

        Equipment is a little bit tricky depending on what type of species you are going for. For me, personally, I enjoy all year fishing, Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter!
        Depending on the type of species you are going for, in this instance, let's say it's fall time and I want to fish for salmon in the river. In this case I would need
        a net for sure, a fly and/or casting rod with a reel that can handle the currents and drift down stream. Lures on the otherhand are a vast variety of different combos,
        Salmon are more into flies, eggs, and other insects, so just about anything that resembles one of those would work great!
